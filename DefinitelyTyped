To use DefinitelyTyped, you can simply install the type definitions for the libraries you want to use. For example, to use the React library, you would install the following package:

npm install @types/react

Once you have installed the type definitions, you can use them in your TypeScript code. For example, the following code uses the React type definitions to create a React component:

import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>Hello, world!</div>
  );
};

export default App;
